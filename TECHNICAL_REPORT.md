# Portfolio Website Technical Report

## Project Overview
Role: Full-Stack Developer | Self-Initiated Project

This personal portfolio was fully developed by me using web technologies and my practical experience with Linux and Windows environments. I didn't rely on external templates or frameworks — instead, I used logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and common sense shaped by my background in programming (C and Python) to design and implement every part of this website. I also made use of AI-assisted tools like Vibe Coding and Gemini to support and accelerate my workflow.

## Technical Stack

### Frontend Framework
- **React.js** (with Vite as build tool)
- Uses modern React features including:
  - Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback)
  - Component-based architecture
  - React Router for navigation

### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

  - Pulse animations
  - Interactive hover states

### Interactive Features

#### Network Background Animation
- Custom-built interactive canvas-based background
- Features:
  - Dynamic node generation
  - Interactive particle system
  - Responsive to user interaction (mouse/touch)
  - Automatic connection drawing between nodes
  - Energy/lightning effects
  - Adaptive node count based on screen size
  - Performance optimizations for mobile devices

#### UI Components
1. **Navigation**
