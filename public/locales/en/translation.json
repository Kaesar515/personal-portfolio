I also made use of AI-assisted tools such as Vibe Coding and Gemini for suggestions, debugging, and productivity boosts.<br><br>Attention was also given to security practices, including implementing a secure contact form featuring backend processing, spam prevention via hCaptcha, and input sanitization.<br><br><a href=\"https://github.com/Kaesar515/personal-portfolio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-[#00e1ff] hover:text-[#00f2ff] transition-colors duration-300 cursor-pointer inline-flex items-center\">View the code → <svg class=\"inline-block w-6 h-6 ml-1\" fill=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M12 2C6.477 2 2 6.477 2 12c0 4.42 2.865 8.17 6.839 9.49.5.092.682-.217.682-.482 0-.237-.008-.866-.013-1.7-2.782.604-3.369-1.34-3.369-1.34-.454-1.156-1.11-1.464-1.11-1.464-.908-.62.069-.608.069-.608 1.003.07 1.531 1.03 1.531 1.03.892 1.529 2.341 1.087 2.91.832.092-.647.35-1.088.636-1.338-2.22-.253-4.555-1.11-4.555-4.943 0-1.091.39-1.984 1.029-2.683-.103-.253-.446-1.27.098-2.647 0 0 .84-.269 2.75 1.025A9.564 9.564 0 0112 6.844c.85.004 1.705.115 2.504.337 1.909-1.294 2.747-1.025 2.747-1.025.546 1.377.203 2.394.1 2.647.64.699 1.028 1.592 1.028 2.683 0 3.842-2.339 4.687-4.566 4.935.359.309.678.919.678 1.852 0 1.336-.012 2.415-.012 2.743 0 .267.18.578.688.48C19.137 20.167 22 16.418 22 12c0-5.523-4.477-10-10-10z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" /></svg></a>",
